This repository was created as part of the "Final Test of the Basic Block".

 
The following problem was solved: write a program that, from an existing array of strings, forms a new array of strings, the length of which is less than or equal to 3 characters. The source array can be entered from the keyboard or specified at the beginning of the algorithm. Collections were not recommended in the decision; it was proposed to use exclusively arrays.

Examples: [“Hello”, “2”, “world”, “:-)”] → [“2”, “:-)”] [“1234”, “1567”, “-2”, “computer science” ] → [“-2”] [“Russia”, “Denmark”, “Kazan”] → []
